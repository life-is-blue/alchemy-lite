# Pre-push Hook: Final checks before sharing code
#
# Why NOT run integration tests here?
#   - Integration tests depend on external network (example.com, cloud.tencent.com)
#   - Network failures would block legitimate pushes
#   - Git operations should work offline
#   - Integration tests belong in CI/CD, not local hooks
#
# Philosophy:
#   - Local hooks verify code quality (unit tests, linting)
#   - CI/CD verifies production readiness (integration tests, deployment)
#   - Never block local workflow on external dependencies
